Mecca, at its beginning, was a small town inhabited by the sons of Adam until it was destroyed during the flood that struck the earth during the reign of the Prophet of God Noah. - Peace be upon him -, and after that the area became a dry valley surrounded by mountains on all sides.";

From it the principles of Islam were spread to all people, and under its banner the Arabian Peninsula was united. For the first time in history, Egypt, the Levant, Iraq, and Persia joined under its banner, so that the Arab tribes became a nation that fulfilled the promise of God Almighty through its hands, and was worthy of carrying this shining glory, generation after generation.";
